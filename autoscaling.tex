\section{Autoscaling}

Heat also provides an autoscaling service for groups of virtual servers. Currently, this is accessible only by creating a Heat template containing the relevant resources (there is no separate \textsc{Rest} API).

The resources involved are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:autoscaling}: a launch configuration (for new servers being added to the group), a scaling group, OpenStack Metering (Ceilometer) alarms, and scaling policies. Scaling groups can also update a load balancer configuration when their membership changes. Ceilometer alarms call a webhook---typically the one provided by the scaling policy resource in Heat---under defined circumstances, and a scaling policy will make adjustments to a scaling group based on this input and its own configuration.
